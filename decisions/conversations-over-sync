# Use Conversations instead of Sync for Messaging history, Sync for Voice history

## Context
How do we best capture messaging interactions in the dev softphone? We need to have a small "history" that tracks the SMS conversation for inbound and outbound messages, and we need to render said messages in the UI.

We also need to capture and display voice call history.

## Decision
Use Conversations for Messaging. Don't have to ask questions about data structure.
For Voice history we will use Sync to store to/from/direction/duration/status.

## Also considered
Sync was considered - Conversations is just a layer on top of Sync, and may not scale as well to complex future use cases, like multiple Conversations on the soft phone.

There is no equivalent to Conversations for Voice calls.

## Consequences
